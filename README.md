# My projects
## CharacterCounter
This is the first project I made. I made this by and for myself just to get better in Javascript.
The purpose of the project is that you can count the amount of characters in a text or word.

## TypTop
This is the second project I made. I made this as a project for my school Odisee Brussel.
You need to have a Gravatar account to login. After logging in you can play 2 games. The first game is just the original type game. The faster you finish and the lower the eroors you made the higher your score will be.
I implemented a second game as a free add-on we needed to implement. This game is a race against the clock. You need to finish the game in 20 seconds. If you can't finish the characters you didn't type will be added to the errors. If you finish before the 20 seconds you will earn bonus points.
There is also a page for seeing your highscores in both games wich are stored in localstorage.
